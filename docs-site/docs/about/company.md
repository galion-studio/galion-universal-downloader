# 🏢 About Galion Studio

<div align="center">

### **Building Tools for Digital Freedom**

*We believe in a world where information flows freely, tools are open, and users own their data.* 🏴‍☠️

</div>

---

## 🌟 Who We Are

**Galion Studio** is a collective of developers, designers, and digital freedom advocates building open-source tools that empower users.

We're not a traditional company. We're a **community-driven initiative** focused on:

- 🔓 **Open Source Development** — All our code is MIT licensed
- 🛡️ **Privacy-First Tools** — Zero tracking, zero telemetry
- 🌍 **Global Accessibility** — Tools that work anywhere
- 🤝 **Community Collaboration** — Built by and for the community

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

> *"To build tools that give people control over their digital lives."*

In an age where:
- Content disappears without warning
- Platforms shut down overnight
- Data is locked behind paywalls
- Privacy is treated as a luxury

We build tools that put **users first**. Tools that are:
- **Free** — No subscriptions, no paywalls
- **Open** — Inspect the code, verify it does what we say
- **Private** — Your data stays yours
- **Persistent** — Download it, own it, keep it forever

---

## 🏴‍☠️ The Philosophy

### The Pirate Bay Spirit

We're inspired by the original spirit of The Pirate Bay (2003) — not the piracy, but the **philosophy**.

> *"We believe information wants to be free."*

This doesn't mean "steal everything." It means:
- **Public information should stay public**
- **Archival is important and legal**
- **Users have rights to their own data**
- **Decentralization protects freedom**

### Our Principles

1. **Open Source Forever**
   - Every tool we build is MIT licensed
   - No exceptions, no time limits
   - Fork us, improve us, distribute us

2. **Privacy by Design**
   - We can't track what we don't collect
   - No telemetry baked into our tools
   - Your data never touches our servers

3. **User Freedom**
   - You own your downloads
   - You control your data
   - You decide what to do with it

4. **Community First**
   - Issues are answered
   - PRs are reviewed
   - Ideas are welcomed

5. **Transparency**
   - Every decision is documented
   - Code is readable and commented
   - No hidden agendas

## 🏴‍☠️ The Manifesto

```
We are not pirates who steal.
We are archivists who preserve.

We are not hackers who break.
We are builders who create.

We are not rebels without cause.
We are advocates with purpose.

In a digital world of walled gardens,
We plant open forests.

In an economy of surveillance,
We build tools of privacy.

In an age of corporate control,
We champion user freedom.

Join us.
Build with us.
Sail with us.

The digital seas are vast,
And there's room for everyone.

                    — Galion Studio 🏴‍☠️
