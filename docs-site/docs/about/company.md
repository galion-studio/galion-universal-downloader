## Who We Are

Galion is not a company. **Galion is a movement.**

We are developers, hackers, dreamers, and believers in information freedom. We come from all corners of the world, united by a single belief:

> **Information wants to be free.**

---

## The Galion Manifesto

```
In a world where content is locked behind paywalls,
Where corporations decide what you can access,
Where your downloads are tracked, throttled, and controlled,

We build different.

We build tools that put YOU in control.
Tools that respect your privacy.
Tools that work offline, on your machine.
Tools that no one can take away.

We are Galion.
We are the community.
We are unstoppable.

🏴‍☠️
```

## Our Philosophy

### 📖 Information Freedom
Knowledge and content should be accessible to everyone, regardless of geography, payment ability, or status. We build tools that help break down barriers to information.

### 🔓 Open Source Forever
Our code is MIT licensed. It lives on GitHub, on countless forks, on hard drives around the world. No corporation, no government can close this door. If they try, a thousand more will open.

### 🛡️ Privacy First
We don't track you. We don't collect data. We don't phone home. Your downloads, your history, your data - it all stays on YOUR machine.

### 🤝 Community Driven
Galion belongs to everyone who contributes. Every pull request, every bug report, every feature suggestion makes us stronger.

### ⚔️ Fighting the Good Fight
Like The Pirate Bay before us, we believe in standing up for digital rights. We provide tools - how users choose to use them is their responsibility and their right.

---

## What We're NOT

Let's be clear:

- ❌ We are **NOT** a piracy site
- ❌ We do **NOT** host any content
- ❌ We do **NOT** store your downloads
- ❌ We do **NOT** track your activity
- ❌ We do **NOT** endorse illegal downloads

We are a **TOOL** - like a web browser, like wget, like curl. We facilitate downloads from URLs. What content you choose to download, and whether you have the right to download it, is YOUR responsibility.

---

## What We ARE

- ✅ A **free, open-source download manager**
- ✅ A **neutral tool** for accessing content
- ✅ A **community-driven project**
- ✅ An **advocate for user rights**
- ✅ A **privacy-respecting application**

## Legal Stance

### Our Position

Galion Universal Downloader is a **neutral technology**. Like:
- A web browser that can access any website
- A knife that can cut vegetables or something else
- A car that can drive to work or participate in a getaway

The tool itself has legitimate uses:
- Archiving content you've purchased
- Downloading free and open content
- Backing up your own uploads
- Accessing content from platforms with poor native download options
- Research and educational purposes

### User Responsibility

Users are **solely responsible** for:
- Ensuring they have rights to download content
- Complying with local copyright laws
- Respecting creators' rights
- Using the tool ethically

### DMCA & Takedowns

We do not host content. If you are a rights holder with concerns, please understand:
- We cannot remove content we don't host
- We are a tool provider, not a content platform
- Contact the platform hosting the content directly

## History

### 2024 - The Beginning
Galion started as a simple download script for CivitAI models. Frustrated with slow downloads and lack of batch capabilities, we built something better.

### 2025 - Going Universal
We expanded to support multiple platforms: GitHub, YouTube, Telegram, HuggingFace, and generic URLs. The community grew.

### The Future
Our roadmap includes:
- Download queues and scheduling
- More platform integrations
- Decentralized mirror support
- Community-driven development
